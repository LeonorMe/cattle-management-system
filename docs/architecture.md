**Architecture Decision Documents (ADDs)**—often called **ADR (Architecture Decision Records)**—are small, structured documents where you record important technical decisions, _why_ you made them, and what alternatives you considered.

They create a clear history of decisions so that:

- future you knows why something was chosen
- the client or collaborators can understand rationale
- future developers can extend the system without breaking constraints
- you avoid revisiting or re-debating old decisions
